## CIP Frontend

First, run the development server:

Cardano CIP Frontend
We wanted to build a CIP Frontend as open and inclusive as Cardano. A repository that is in the hands of the Cardano community and can be constantly evolved by it.

For this to be successful, the repository relies on your contributions, and the fact that you are reading this text probably means that you have something to contribute.


Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-cip-frontend.git
Navigate into the folder
cd cf-cip-frontend
Install all dependencies
npm install
Production build
Create at least once a production build (as this pulls missing files)

npm run build
Local development
npm run dev
This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
